# Budget Management

Treat tokens as a strict budget. When building an implementation plan or making multi-file edits, consider the cognitive load you are adding to the session.

## Proactive Budgeting

- **Plan Length**: Keep implementation plans concise. If a plan requires 5 scrolling pages, it is too complex. Break it down.
- **Checkpoints**: At natural stopping points, summarize what has been done and what remains. This helps recover context if the session is truncated.
- **File Batching**: If you need to edit 10 files, do not view all 10 simultaneously. Group them logically (e.g., "Domain models first, then Services").
- **Discarding Constraints**: If early constraints in a conversation are no longer relevant, explicitly state this in a summary so the context window can "forget" the old, conflicting rules.
